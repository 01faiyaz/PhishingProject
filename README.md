# PhishingProject
A Personal Project I delved into in order to understand the concept of phishing and its counter intuitive attacks

Phishing is a malicious attempt to display a website or source as authentic in order to steal credentials of users who visit the source.
A way to distinguish a Phishing attack is most commonly by the URL

USED:

Node.js

Express.js

PHP

Javascript

HTML

Creates a basic logs file through .json with other users credentials who attempt to register.
Only done for my own educational purpose.
